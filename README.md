Use Xcode playgrounds to play with generative art projects. API is UIKit (easier to find answers for on stackoverflow) and CoreGraphics.

To save the images as PDF the directory 
*~/Documents/Shared Playground Data* needs to exist (Xcode won't set it up).

Converted generative art by [kovach.me](https://www.kovach.me/posts/2018-03-07-generating-art.html) from Haskell and the Cairo rendering engine to XCode playgrounds and CoreGraphics.
